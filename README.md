# RAG-chatgpt-project-
Hello everyone! My name is Deva Siva Ganesh, and today I will be explaining the key functionalities and implementation details of my Jupyter Notebook named SITHAPALTA21557.ipynb. This notebook focuses on solving a Natural Language Processing problem using state-of-the-art models like GPT-2 and FLAN-T5 from the Hugging Face Transformers library. I will walk you through the main components, including library installation, model implementation, and response generation.
The notebook starts by installing essential libraries required for NLP tasks. Here is the first code snippet:

python
Copy code
!pip install requests beautifulsoup4 faiss-cpu sentence-transformers transformers
These libraries include:

Requests: For handling HTTP requests.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping, which can be useful for gathering text data.
faiss-cpu: A library for similarity search.
Sentence Transformers: To generate embeddings for text.
Transformers: A key library from Hugging Face for implementing pre-trained NLP models like GPT-2 and FLAN-T5.
The next part of the notebook implements a function to generate responses using the GPT-2 model. The following code defines this function:

python
Copy code
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

def generate_response(relevant_chunks, query, model_name='gpt2'):
    # Implementation details here
Explanation:

The function takes two inputs: relevant_chunks (text context) and query (a question).
It loads the GPT-2 model and tokenizer to generate text responses based on the input.
GPT-2 is a powerful language model designed to predict the next word in a sentence, making it excellent for generating coherent responses.
The notebook also demonstrates a function for generating responses using Google’s FLAN-T5 model, which is more advanced and optimized for text-to-text tasks. Here’s the code snippet:

python
Copy code
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

def generate_response(relevant_chunks, query, model_name='google/flan-t5-base'):
    # Implementation details here
FLAN-T5 Highlights:

It is a text-to-text model, meaning it takes input text and generates output text.
The FLAN-T5 model is particularly effective for question-answering tasks because it has been fine-tuned on a wide variety of tasks and datasets.
This demonstrates how the notebook leverages the latest NLP technologies to generate accurate and contextual responses.

To summarize, the SITHAPALTA21557.ipynb notebook demonstrates:

Installation of libraries required for NLP.
Implementation of GPT-2 and FLAN-T5 models for generating text responses.
Practical usage of the Hugging Face Transformers library for real-world applications like question answering and text generation.
This notebook highlights my ability to work with pre-trained models, write clean and structured code, and implement solutions for NLP tasks.

Thank you for this opportunity to present my work. I look forward to contributing my skills to innovative projects at Sithafal Technologies.
